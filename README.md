# Cable label

A label for labelling cables.

The label is designed to be attached to a cable using two cable ties.
The label can be marked with a permanent marker or a laser engraver.
This label was primarily designed to be attached to Ethernet cables but should work on others cables as well.

The label was designed as a printed circuit board and can be manufactured from the Gerber files. The DXF file could also probably be laser cut to make the label out of acrylic, plywood or similar. I will probably redraw it in Inkscape to make a SVG file for laser cutting in the future.
